Here you can configure when the Updater runs your software, and when it auto-closes itself. You can also configure if the Updater should close your software before updating it.<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Run My Software</b><br>
Have the Updater run your software. This is especially useful after Updates are applied, because your software must have been closed to accomplish this.<br>


<br>

<b>Close My Software</b><br>
Your software is only closed right before an Update is applied. The process's EXE Name (like "MySoftware.exe") is used to figure out if your program is running, and then close it. The user will be warned before your program is closed.<br>
