<br><br>

The Full Release Folder is used to store an exact copy of what is to end up on the user's computer.<br>
<br>
When you click "Release in Full and Updates", the Full Release Folder will be fully erased, and your newest version's folder will be copied into it, as well as a generated Updater.<br>
<br>
Created <a href="installers.html" TARGET=CONTENT>Installers</a> use this folder as the source of what they should install.<br>
<br>
<i>Recommended Use:</i> Leave at default location, unless the hard drive free space is less than the size of your software. Only referr to this location if you are using a 3rd party Installer solution.
<br>
<i>Not Recommended:</i> In Sync Mode, you may choose to use the same path for your Full Release Folder as you used for your latest version's folder. In this case, the Full Release Folder will not befully erased, 
and the new Updater is copied into it as usual. Patch Mode does not allow this to help ensure that version's folders are not altered after their release.<br>
