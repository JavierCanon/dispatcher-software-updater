<br><br>

The Update Data Folder is a local copy of the update data that must be uploaded to all Update Mirrors, so the Updater can update from them.<br>
<br>
When you click "Release in Full and Release Update Data" or "Release Update Data Only", this folder is fully erased, and update data is generated into it.<br>
<br>
If you checked "Auto-Upload Update Data to Update Mirrors", update data will automatically be uploaded to all <a href="updatemirrors.html" TARGET=CONTENT>Update Mirrors</a> that you configured Auto-Upload URLs for.<br>
<br>
<i>Recommended Use:</i> Leave at default location. Allow Dispatcher to Auto-Upload to all your Update Mirrors.<br>
<br>
<i>Not Recommended:</i> If you don't Auto-Upload the Update Data found in here after you release updates, you must manually upload ALL changed files from this folder to each of your mirrors. 
If you forget to upload even a single file, the Updater will be unable to update your software.<br>
